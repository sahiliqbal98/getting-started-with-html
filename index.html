  <p><b>Notes from first week of nanodegree lessons</b></p>
<em><b>How the web works</b></em><br>
<p>There are three main aspects of how the web works. Those aspects are browsers, the internet, and servers.
My understanding of this is that a person would use their browser to access a website on the internet such as www.google.com, and that would send a http request to the servers. Then the servers would return a HTML document that would correspond with the users request.</p>
<b><em>Tags and Elements</em></b><br>
<p>HTML documents use elements, and we tell the browsers about these elements using tags. Tags have many fuctions.Basic ones being making text bold, adding links, images, italics, and ending lines or creating a so called imaginary box around text for seperation purposes.</p>
<p><b><em>WHY COMPUTERS ARE STUPID</em></b></p><br>
Computers are stupid because they interpret what you tell them to do in the most literal fashion possible.This makes it difficult because if you miss a end bracket or something, then what you were attempting to do with your code would not work and you would not know why until further inspection. But this also means that if you understand how it works, you can use computers as a very powerful tool as they will always do what you tell them.
